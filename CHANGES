### Version History

Version 2.1.0:
    * Added experimental support for HandBrakeCLI.
    * Requires Python 3.7 or higher
    * Removed Plex integration.
    * Removed Sonarr integration
    * Fixed typo in sample.yml and updated Cuda examples.

Version 2.0.14:
    * Fixed ffprobe output parsing problem - thanks Grant.

Version 2.0.13
    * Added support for ffprobe media analysis as a fallback if normal ffmpeg info dump parsing fails.
    * Fixed a regex issue where certain patterns in a "path" criteria didn't match
    * Tweaks to the sample transcode.yml

Version 2.0.12
    * Fixed bad unlink() reference in threshold cleanup.

Version 2.0.11
    * Fixed bug preventing completed work items from being removed from the queue file.

Version 2.0.10
    * Fixed but on Windows trying to detect mounted filesystem.  Not available under Windows.

Version 2.0.9
    * Added 'fls_path' option to transcode.yml, which allows designating a "fast local storage" path where
      output is written during transcode rather than thrashing your network share/NAS with many small reads
      and writes. Final output is moved to the share when complete.  Only applicable if the input file is on
      a detected network share.

    * Configuration files now require lists to use the multi-line YAML format for consistency (see updated example included)

Version 2.0.8
    * Fixed automap=No recognition problem using non-clustered transcoding.

Version 2.0.7
    * Fixed minor string formatting problem on abort of encode.

Version 2.0.6
    * Suppress summary on --dry-run

Version 2.0.5
    * Fixed another unhandled exception collecting statistics when using non-clustered transcoding.

Version 2.0.4
    * Fixed unhandled exception collecting statistics when using non-clustered transcoding.

Version 2.0.3
    * Prevent error message when remote host health testing times out.
    * Fixed erroneous "queue file not found" message.

Version 2.0.2
    * Added summary output of full job with elapsed time
    * Fixed output bug which failed to report proper filename on termination of encode job.

Version 2.0.1
    * Added "automap" setting to Global and Profile sections to expressly enable or disable mapping (default is ENABLED).
    * Added include_languages to "audio" and "subtitle" profile sections.  Use Include or Exclude, not both.  If you
      use both then Includes will take precedence.
    * Enabled audio and subtitle filtering in cluster mode too.
    * Fixed bug in inverted vcodec check (ex. vcodec !h264)
    * Fixed bug where cluster mode wasn't removing completed jobs from the queue file.
    * Been running reliably and well for months now - time for a version bump to 2.0!
    * Added a ctrl-c (sigint) handler to prevent threads from removing original media during termination.
      This seems to be a python 3.7 thing.

Version 1.5.12
    * Merging of input_options and output_options supported at the option level. For example, if the included
      profiles has "-c:a copy" and the including profile has "-c:a libmp3lame", the including profile option will
      take precedence.

Version 1.5.11
    * Default behavior is to now auto-map all audio and subtitle streams during transcode.
        May be disabled at the global or profile level with  automap: no
    * More unit test fixes and improvements.
    * Updated sample transcode.yml for better feature reference

Version 1.5.10
    * Fixed broken unit tests from previous release
    * Fixed rule predicates matching on runtime after conversion to seconds-level detail.

Version 1.5.9
    * Added new optional "include" directive in profiles to help reduce profile repetition.
    * Fixed error message when input file not found.
    * Fixed divide-by-zero error when video runtime < 1 minute. Calculations how include seconds rather than just whole minutes

Version 1.5.8
    * Updated yaml loader to support latest pyyaml library.

Version 1.5.7
    * Threshold check termination resulted in a misleading error message.
    * Windows wildcard expansion fixed.
    * Changed rule criteria for range matching to be inclusive. So 30-60 now mean between 30 and 60 inclusively.

Version 1.5.5
    * Threshold check termination resulted in a misleading error message.
    * Doc link to video series part 2.
    * Cluster documentation revised and corrected.

Version 1.5.4
    * Fixed bug that suppressed certain ffmpeg error condition messages.
    * -k flag ignored under certain situations.
    * Doc link to video series part 1.
    * Fixed some code inconsistencies regarding global flags

Version 1.5.3
    * Removed requirement for queue configuration if not using queues.
    * Documentation and Pipfile tweaks.

Version 1.5.2
    * Fixed media info parsing problem with file generated from Final Cut Pro X
    * Fixed regex problem matching pathname in a rule
    * Fixed divide by zero error on status output when not using hardware acceleration
    * Tightened up the output
    * Fixed color output
    * Better test coverage with mocking.

Version 1.4.7
    * Multi-queue support in cluster mode. Run multiple concurrent jobs on remote machines now.
    * import error in utils.py
    * -t option removed from ssh as it was screwing up the local terminal output

Version 1.4.6
    * Configuration file change: "rules" section of each rule renamed to "criteria" for clarity.

Version 1.4.5
    * Calculate and show compression % in progress output
    * Allow cluster mode profile override
    * Added threshold_check to enable threshold checking to start at designated percentage done.
    * Cluster mode -k option fix.

Version 1.4.4
    * Optional colorized terminal output.
    * Encode runs are logged for inspection if something goes wrong.
    * Cluster mode not honoring default queue file.
    * Cluster mode --host override fixed.

Version 1.4.1
    * Regex problem monitoring ffmpeg output.
    * Refactored ffmpeg control into a class

Version 1.3
    * Added support for local host in the cluster so that the same host managing work also does work.
    * Monitoring of ffmpeg jobs and progress reporting.
    * Support for multiple allowed profiles for a host.
    * New --host commandline option to force cluster encodes on a designated host only
    * Large code refactoring.

Version 1.2.2
    * Path to ssh is now configurable.

Version 1.2.1
    * Multiple queue definitions, allowing for more fine threading control.
    * New cluster mode to allow for agent-less, multi-machine encode offloading.

Version 1.0.0
    * Initial Release to pypi.org
