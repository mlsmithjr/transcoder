        May be disabled at the global or profile level with  automap: no
    * More unit test fixes and improvements.
    * Updated sample transcode.yml for better feature reference

Version 1.5.10
    * Fixed broken unit tests from previous release

Version 1.5.9
    * Added new optional "include" directive in profiles to help reduce profile repetition.

    * Updated yaml loader to support latest pyyaml library.

Version 1.5.7

Version 1.5.5
    * Threshold check termination resulted in a misleading error message.

    * Cluster documentation revised and corrected.

Version 1.5.4
    * Fixed bug that suppressed certain ffmpeg error condition messages.
    * -k flag ignored under certain situations.

Version 1.5.2
    * Fixed media info parsing problem with file generated from Final Cut Pro X
    * Fixed regex problem matching pathname in a rule
    * Fixed divide by zero error on status output when not using hardware acceleration
    * Tightened up the output
    * Fixed color output
    * Better test coverage with mocking.

Version 1.4.7
    * Multi-queue support in cluster mode. Run multiple concurrent jobs on remote machines now.
    * import error in utils.py
    * -t option removed from ssh as it was screwing up the local terminal output

Version 1.4.6
    * Configuration file change: "rules" section of each rule renamed to "criteria" for clarity.

Version 1.4.5

    * Refactored ffmpeg control into a class

Version 1.3
    * Added support for local host in the cluster so that the same host managing work also does work.
    * Monitoring of ffmpeg jobs and progress reporting.
    * Support for multiple allowed profiles for a host.
    * New --host commandline option to force cluster encodes on a designated host only
    * Large code refactoring.

Version 1.2.2
